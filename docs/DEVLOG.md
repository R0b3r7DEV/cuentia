### 2026-07-11 — Entry 049: Work orders — the electrician's everyday job (P1, backend)
**Done (P1 of [PLAN-v2](../PLAN-v2.md), backend PR)**
- `WorkOrder` + `WorkOrderLine` entities: customer, title, description, status
  (`pendiente→en_curso→terminado→facturado`), scheduled time, labour (hours × rate + VAT) and material
  lines in exact integer cents. New tables only — the invoice hash chain is untouched.
- `WorkOrderService::convert()` reuses `QuoteService::convert()` **exactly**: a `convertedInvoice` link makes
  it idempotent (convert twice ⇒ same invoice). Materials → invoice lines, labour → one "Mano de obra (N h)"
  line. Issued through `InvoiceService::create()`, so it inherits gapless numbering + the chain record and
  respects the billing mode (ADR 0004).
- `WorkOrderController`: CRUD + `/convert`, all user-scoped; an invoiced order is immutable (409).
- Tests: `WorkOrderServiceTest` + an integration test that **converts twice and asserts a single invoice**
  (total = materials + labour), isolation, immutability. 91 tests, 401 assertions.

**Next**
- P1 PR2 — mobile UI, photos and the client signature.

### 2026-07-11 — Entry 048: Dual billing mode — real invoices by default, Verifactu as a demo
**What happened**
- Every invoice carried an AEAT **test-host QR** and a "Verifactu" legend, because `InvoiceService` always
  writes a record and the PDF printed the QR whenever one existed. A real invoice for the pilot's real
  client would ship a pre-production QR. Wrong for real use.

**Done (P0 of [PLAN-v2](../PLAN-v2.md))**
- Per-user `User.billingMode` (`standard` default / `verifactu` demo) + issuer fiscal profile
  (`businessName`, `fiscalAddress`) so a standard **RD 1619/2012** invoice is complete. Migration backfills
  existing rows to `standard`.
- `InvoicePdf::build(..., bool $showVerifactu)`: QR + legend only in demo mode; the standard PDF is an
  ordinary invoice. `/qr` and `/xml` return **403** in standard mode.
- **The hash chain runs in both modes.** `VerifactuHasher::fingerprint()` does not include the mode, so
  switching mode never breaks `GET /api/invoices/verify` over pre-existing invoices — asserted by a
  regression test.
- Account UI: a plain-language mode selector + issuer form; invoices UI hides the QR/XML/chain in standard
  mode and shows a DEMO banner in Verifactu mode. Spanish, non-technical.
- Verified the obligation date against the BOE: autónomos from **1 July 2027** (RD-ley 15/2025); optional in
  2026. See [ADR 0004](../decisions/0004-dual-billing-mode.md), [guide 38](guide/38-dual-billing-mode.md).
- 85 tests, 379 assertions.

**Next**
- P1 — work orders (partes de trabajo).

### 2026-07-10 — Entry 047: The plan is checked against ITC-BT-25, and the panel is drawn from it
**What happened**
- The designer computed the minimum points per room **and then ignored them**. You could draw a kitchen with
  three sockets, export it and generate the CIE. The core promise of the product was unfulfilled.
- Worse: the minimums themselves were an approximation someone invented. I downloaded the Ministry's
  [GUÍA-BT-25](https://industria.gob.es/Calidad-Industrial/seguridadindustrial/instalacionesindustriales/baja-tension/Documents/bt/guia_bt_25_jul12R2.pdf),
  parsed the PDF and read **tabla 2**. Five discrepancies — see [guide 37](guide/37-itc-bt-25-compliance-and-panel.md).

**Done**
- `roomRequirements()` now *is* tabla 2: the kitchen's nine sockets across four circuits, the "3 sockets or
  one per 6 m², whichever is greater" floor, corridors ruled by **length** not surface, a terrace with no
  socket at all.
- Fixed the grade: more than five circuits requires **an extra differential**, not *electrificación elevada*
  ("no supondrá el paso a electrificación elevada", 2.3.1). We were raising the contracted power from
  5 750 W to 9 200 W for nothing — a real bill for the customer. The eight real triggers are implemented.
- Sockets declare the circuit that feeds them (C2/C3/C4/C5/C10). One that declares none is credited against
  whatever its room still lacks; one that declares the wrong circuit is not.
- `validateLayout()` attributes devices by **point-in-polygon**, measures rooms by the **shoelace formula**
  (an L-shaped salón counts by its real surface), and names each shortfall. **Create CIE is disabled** while
  the plan falls short.
- `panelSchedule()` draws the **main panel (CGMP)** from the devices actually placed: circuits sized by the
  points connected, split at the maximum of tabla 1, IGA from the contracted power, one differential per
  five circuits, and DIN modules counted so the enclosure can be ordered.

**Why it is built this way**
- Both readers share one private `tally()`. Counting twice would eventually make the check and the panel
  disagree about what is installed — a bug that is hell to chase.
- An empty plan reports `checked: false`: **unchecked, not compliant**. A validator that says "OK" to an
  empty input is worse than no validator.
- The app states plainly that a plan can only prove the *number of points of use*. Sections, earthing and
  measurements are outside a drawing. **No software can promise a certificate is never returned**; what this
  closes is the commonest family of rejections.

**Next**
- Frontend tests (there are still none) — starting with the geometry and the homography.

### 2026-07-10 — Entry 046: The real plan underneath, de-skewed; rooms as polygons; the plan downloadable
**Done**
- The scanned plan sits under the 2D editor, its scale calibrated against a known dimension.
- **Four-point rectification.** A phone photo is rotated and keystoned, so a two-point calibration cannot
  save it: calibration recovers *scale* only, and a metre still measures differently across the sheet. The
  user marks the four corners; we solve the **homography** by Gaussian elimination and remap the image with
  bilinear sampling. Verified: corners land within 1e-13 px and straight lines stay straight.
- A self-intersecting or near-flat quad still yields a **solvable** system while collapsing the image, so
  convexity is checked separately. The first version of that guard let three collinear points through — a
  cross product of exactly zero is neither positive nor negative.
- Rooms are **polygons**: an L-shaped living room, a corridor. Drag an edge midpoint to spawn a vertex.
  Moving a room carries the devices inside it (members snapshotted at drag start).
- The finished plan downloads as a **PNG** with backdrop, areas, devices, legend and scale.
- Navigation regrouped: one *Panel* menu; Certificates and Installation became top-level routes.
- Production hardening: a rejected backdrop returned **200 with `background: null`** — the user watched their
  traced plan vanish. It now fails loudly with a stable code. And the container no longer swallows migration
  failures with `|| true`: serving traffic against a mismatched schema is how a login turns into a 500.

### 2026-07-09 — Entry 045: Production login broke — a missing migration, a CI guard, and better auth errors
**What happened**
- Login (and register) returned **500 in production**. Not a password problem: `/api/health` was fine, but a
  fake login returned 500 instead of 401. Cause: the BYOK feature added three encrypted columns to
  `app_user`, **but the migration was never generated** — `make:migration` had failed silently because the
  local PostgreSQL was down, and I only checked the test output. Doctrine then queried columns that didn't
  exist in the production database.
- **Why the tests didn't catch it:** the test schema is built from the *entity metadata* (SchemaTool on
  in-memory SQLite), never from the *migrations*. 59 green tests with a broken database. A real blind spot.

**Fixed**
- Confirmed the drift with `doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql`, generated + applied the missing migration
  (`Version20260709094713`, three nullable columns — safe on existing rows), pushed; Render applied it on
  boot. Verified against production: login now answers **401** (invalid credentials), not 500.

**The real fix — a CI guard**
- New CI job **"Migrations (schema in sync)"**: spins up a real PostgreSQL, runs **every migration from
  scratch**, then `doctrine:schema:validate`. If an entity changes without its migration, **CI goes red**
  before it can reach production. This is the class of bug the unit tests structurally cannot see.

**Also: professional auth errors**
- Failures now carry a stable machine-readable `code` the frontend translates: `bad_credentials`,
  `email_taken`, `invalid_email`, `weak_password`, `too_many_attempts`, plus server/network fallbacks. A
  custom `AuthenticationFailureHandler` returns clean JSON. **Login stays deliberately generic** — the same
  401 whether the account exists or the password is wrong, so nobody can enumerate registered emails; a test
  asserts the two responses are byte-identical. Minimum password raised to 8 characters (registration only,
  so existing accounts keep working). Suite now **60 tests, 273 assertions**.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 044: Bring-your-own-key integrations (encrypted, per user)
**Done**
- Users can now enable AI and open banking from **Account → Integrations** by pasting their **own** keys —
  no env vars needed by the end user. Keys are **encrypted at rest** (`SecretCipher`, AES-256-GCM from the
  app secret) and never returned to the client (status shows only configured + a masked hint).
  `CredentialStore` resolves per-user keys with an env fallback; refactored `ChatService`,
  `CategorizerService`, `GoCardlessClient` (now `configure()`d per request), `OpenBankingService` and
  `BankController` to read through it. New account endpoints (GET status, PUT/DELETE anthropic & gocardless)
  + an Account UI section. Migration adds three encrypted columns on `User`. Suite now **58 tests, 250
  assertions** (cipher round-trip/tamper + an end-to-end BYOK test where saving GoCardless creds enables
  `/api/bank/status` for that user).

**Why**
- The features were gated behind server env vars an end user can't touch. BYOK makes them self-serve and
  honest (each user's own key), while staying secure — secrets encrypted, never echoed back.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR could now build on a user's own Claude key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 043: Mobile navbar — icons instead of labels
**Done**
- Fixed the navbar overflowing/overlapping on phones. Each nav item now has an icon + a text label: desktop
  shows the **label** (unchanged look), mobile (≤820px) shows just the **icon**. The long user email
  collapses to a 👤 icon and logout to 🚪, so everything fits in a compact row. Tightened mobile paddings and
  the watermark size. Frontend/CSS only.

**Why**
- On a phone the five link names + the full email + three buttons wrapped and overlapped; icons keep it
  legible and small without touching the desktop layout.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 042: Installation designer — Phase 3 (3D floor-plan view)
**Done**
- `FloorPlan3D` (react-three-fiber): extrudes the 2D layout into semi-transparent walls, places devices at
  realistic heights (socket 0.3 / switch 1.1 / light 2.4 emissive / panel 1.2 m) and the panel, with a
  floor + grid and **OrbitControls** (rotate/zoom/pan). Reads the same `layout` as the 2D editor. It's
  **lazy-loaded** behind a "View in 3D" toggle — the build confirms it splits into its own chunk
  (`FloorPlan3D-*.js` ≈ 900 kB), so Three.js only downloads on demand and the main bundle is unchanged.
  Added `three` + `@react-three/fiber@9` + `@react-three/drei@10` (React 19 compatible). No backend change.

**Why**
- This is Phase 3 of the designer (enfoque B): a useful 2D model with an optional 3D presentation layer.
  The whole electrician flow now runs design → 2D plan → 3D view → CIE → quote → invoice.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR (need an Anthropic key). Designer could later gain textured/first-person 3D, but that's
  a separate product.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 041: Installation designer — Phase 2 (2D floor-plan editor)
**Done**
- Added `FloorPlanEditor`: an SVG floor-plan canvas (metric grid) where rooms are draggable rectangles and
  the panel + devices (socket/switch/light) are placed by tool + click and dragged with Move (Delete
  removes). An **Auto-place** button seeds the plan from the design and drops each room's ITC-BT-25 points
  as devices. `InstallationCalculator::layoutCable()` measures cable as each device's Manhattan run to the
  panel (+drop, +10 % slack), so the UI shows **"Cable from plan: N m"** instead of the estimate once a
  layout exists. Layout persists as a JSON column on `Installation` (migration); `/compute` accepts a
  `layout`. Suite now **55 tests, 244 assertions** (2 calculator + 1 integration).

**Why**
- Phase 1 gave a rough cable estimate from surface; a real layout gives real metres and a schematic plan
  the electrician can hand over. Same model will extrude into 3D in Phase 3.

**Next**
- Phase 3 (extruded walkable 3D). Agentic AI + OCR still need an Anthropic key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 040: Close the loop — design → CIE & design → quote
**Done**
- Wired the installation designer into the rest of the billing module (frontend-only). From a computed
  design, two buttons: **"Create certificate (CIE)"** prefills the Certificados form with the technical
  data (power→kW, voltage, supply, earthing TT, circuits, IGA 25/40 A, differential 30 mA); **"Materials →
  quote"** opens the Presupuestos form with a line per material. Added cross-tab prefill plumbing in
  `BillingPage` (a tab hands data to another; manual tab clicks clear it). No placeholders: the user
  completes the customer/identity where it belongs.

**Why**
- This is the differentiator I kept pointing at: **design → CIE → quote → invoice** in one tool, each step
  feeding the next. The data the electrician already entered once now flows through the whole chain.

**Next**
- Designer Phase 2 (2D plan) / Phase 3 (3D). Agentic AI + OCR still need an Anthropic key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 039: Installation designer — Phase 1 (ITC-BT-25 calculator + single-line diagram)
**Done**
- New **Instalación** tab: a REBT **ITC-BT-25** calculator. `InstallationCalculator` (pure, unit-tested)
  turns rooms + expected loads into circuits (C1–C12 with section/PIA, splitting into C6/C7 when point
  limits are exceeded), minimum points per room, grade & power to contract, differentials, a bill of
  materials and an estimated cable length. `InstallationController` exposes a stateless `/compute` plus CRUD
  to save designs (`Installation` entity, JSON columns; result recomputed from stored input). The frontend
  recomputes live and renders a **single-line diagram (SVG)** + circuits/points/materials tables. Migration
  added. Suite now **52 tests, 233 assertions** (6 calculator unit + integration).
- Researched and grounded in ITC-BT-25 (5 mandatory circuits básico, 9+ elevado; one differential per 5
  circuits; per-room point minima). Honest framing: a pre-dimensioning aid; cable is an estimate; not a
  signed project.

**Why**
- The electrician's design → CIE → quote → invoice chain starts here. This is Phase 1 of the designer we
  scoped (enfoque B); Phase 2 = 2D floor-plan editor, Phase 3 = extruded 3D view.

**Next**
- Phase 2 (2D plan), autofill the CIE from a design, materials → quote. Agentic AI + OCR still need a key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 038: CIE — make it really submittable (sign-ready + AutoFirma)
**Done**
- Took the CIE from "draft" to **sign-ready**. Researched the GVA telematic procedure: documents must be
  **PDF digitally signed** (DNIe / FNMT / ACCV / Cl@ve-firma) and filed by the authorised installer at the
  sede — there is **no third-party submission API**. Chose the secure path (with the user): Cuentia never
  handles the installer's certificate.
- Upgraded `CiePdf` to a complete CERTINS E-style document: full compliance declaration (RD 842/2002 +
  ITC-BT, favourable measurements), *lugar y fecha*, and **reserved digital-signature areas** for the
  company and the installer ("firma electrónica AutoFirma/ACCV"). Added an in-app **"How to sign & file it"**
  panel (download → sign with AutoFirma/ACCV → file at the GVA sede) with official links.

**Why**
- "Presentable de verdad" = a faithful document + a real signature + filing. The signature is done locally
  by the installer (private key never leaves their machine, as GVA recommends); filing has no public API, so
  it stays the installer's manual upload — the same honest boundary as Verifactu's real AEAT submission.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR — both need an Anthropic API key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 037: Electrical Installation Certificate (CIE / CERTINS E)
**Done**
- Researched the Comunitat Valenciana CIE and confirmed an official model — **CERTINS E (12/2012)**, filed
  telematically with a digital signature via the GVA sede electrónica. Implemented a **Certificate** entity
  + `CertificateController` CRUD + `CiePdf` (a CERTINS E-style PDF via Dompdf) + a **Certificados** tab in
  Billing. Fields follow the REBT (RD 842/2002): installation, titular, installer company/installer, and
  technical characteristics (power, voltage, supply, earthing, IGA, differential, etc.). Migration added.
- Honest framing throughout (form note + PDF footer): it's a **fill-in draft aid**, not the official
  telematic+signed submission. Tests: CRUD, validation, PDF, per-user isolation. Suite **45 tests, 192
  assertions**. Guide 32. (Fixed two small bugs the tests caught: an undefined-key read on an unset
  `installationType`, and using null as an array offset in the PDF.)

**Why**
- A real plus for an electrician using the app: the CIE is the document they issue on every job, and
  reusing the same data they already keep for invoicing removes duplicate typing.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR — both need an Anthropic API key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 036: Quotes (presupuestos) + convert-to-invoice
**Done**
- Added **quotes**: `Quote`/`QuoteLine` entities (non-fiscal, no hash chain), `QuoteService`,
  `QuoteController` (`list/create/get/status/convert/pdf`), `QuotePdf`, migration, and a **Presupuestos**
  tab (create with customer + catalog lines + *valid until*, status pill, per-row actions). The headline:
  **convert** copies a quote into `InvoiceService::create()` to produce a fully sealed Verifactu invoice —
  **idempotent** (converts once, never duplicates), then marks the quote `converted` and links it.
- Tests: `QuoteServiceTest` (totals/numbering/default series/draft/empty guard) + an integration test of
  create → status → convert → invoice sealed → idempotent → PDF. Suite now **44 tests, 179 assertions**.
  Guide 31. Fixed a create bug where an unset `status` re-read an undefined key and blanked the status.

**Why**
- Freelancers quote before they invoice; converting the accepted quote in one click (into a compliant
  invoice) is the natural workflow and keeps the fiscal chain separate from non-fiscal offers.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR — both need an Anthropic API key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 035: Services catalog (reusable line items)
**Done**
- Added a reusable **services/products catalog**: `Service` entity (user-scoped name/unitPrice/vatRate),
  `ServiceController` CRUD (`/api/services`), migration `Version20260708075806`, and a **Servicios** tab.
  The new-invoice form gets an **"Add from catalog…"** dropdown that appends a line prefilled from the
  chosen service (still editable). Suite now **40 tests, 157 assertions** (CRUD + validation + isolation).

**Why**
- Freelancers bill the same handful of services repeatedly; a catalog removes the retyping. Lines copy the
  service's values at creation, so deleting a catalog item never rewrites past invoices.

**Next**
- Quotes (presupuestos) — non-fiscal documents that convert into a real Verifactu invoice.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 034: Billing tabs + customer management (CRUD)
**Done**
- Turned the Invoices screen into a **Billing** section with sub-tabs (`BillingPage` → `Facturas`,
  `Clientes`; `Presupuestos`/`Servicios` coming). Added **customer CRUD**: `CustomerController`
  (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/customers`, all user-scoped) with a **delete guard** (409 if the customer has
  invoices) and required `name`/`taxId`. New `Clientes` tab (list + create/edit/delete). Issuing an invoice
  can now reuse an existing customer by **`customerId`** (dropdown in the form); `InvoiceService` resolves
  id → get-or-create.
- Tests: an integration test covering create/list/update, validation (400), the delete guard (409) and
  per-user isolation. Suite now **39 tests, 146 assertions**. Guide 29.

**Why**
- This is the step from "issue a one-off invoice" toward an actual billing tool: customers you reuse, a
  section that can hold quotes and a services catalog next.

**Next**
- A services catalog to prefill lines, then quotes (presupuestos) with convert-to-invoice.

### 2026-07-08 — Entry 033: Invoice PDF (with embedded QR)
**Done**
- Each invoice can now be downloaded as a **professional PDF** (`InvoicePdf` service via **Dompdf**, pure
  PHP): issuer/customer, line table, totals, the Verifactu **huella** and the **QR** embedded as an SVG
  `data:` URI. `GET /api/invoices/{id}/pdf`; the Invoices page shows a **Download PDF** link next to XML.
  Guide 28. Suite now **38 tests, 134 assertions** (unit render + integration endpoint).
- Also refreshed the **README** to showcase Verifactu invoicing and open banking, with an engineering
  highlight on the hash chain and an honestly rewritten scope section.

**Why**
- The QR/XML were developer artifacts; a PDF is the document a freelancer actually sends. Dompdf keeps it
  gd/imagick-free, and DejaVu Sans renders the € sign and accents.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR — both need an Anthropic API key.

### 2026-07-06 — Entry 032: Open banking (GoCardless) — behind a feature flag
**Done**
- Built a real open-banking import via **GoCardless Bank Account Data** (PSD2): `GoCardlessClient` (token →
  institutions → requisition → account transactions), `OpenBankingService` (connect + import with mapping),
  and `BankController` (`/api/bank/status|institutions|connect|import`). Movements now carry an `externalId`
  (migration `Version20260706103931`) so re-imports **skip duplicates**. Frontend `BankConnect` component on
  the Movements page: pick a bank → authorize (hosted GoCardless link) → import.
- **Feature flag:** disabled unless `GOCARDLESS_SECRET_ID`/`_KEY` are set; the UI then shows an honest "not
  configured" note and enabled-only endpoints return 503.
- Tests: `GoCardlessClientTest` (MockHttpClient), `OpenBankingServiceTest` (mapping, creditor-name fallback,
  dedup counts), integration test of the disabled path. Suite now **36 tests, 128 assertions**.

**Why**
- Creating GoCardless app credentials asks for more personal data than makes sense for a portfolio, so the
  integration is built and **tested against the documented API shape but not run live** — shipping it behind
  a flag is the honest way to showcase the capability without pretending it's been exercised end-to-end.

**Next**
- Agentic AI + OCR — both need an Anthropic API key.

### 2026-07-06 — Entry 031: Verifactu invoicing — Phase C (QR + XML)
**Done**
- Each invoice now has its two Verifactu artifacts. `VerifactuQr` builds the AEAT `ValidarQR` URL (nif,
  numserie, fecha, importe) and renders it as an **SVG** via `endroid/qr-code` (SVG needs no gd/imagick);
  `VerifactuXml` serializes a `RegistroAlta` XML with `DOMDocument`. Endpoints `GET /api/invoices/{id}/qr`
  (image/svg+xml) and `/xml` (download). The Invoices page shows the scannable QR + a Download XML link in
  the expanded detail, with a note that it's a faithful demonstration (test host), not a live submission.
- Tests: `VerifactuDocumentsTest` (QR url fields, SVG render, XML well-formed + carries the huella, first-vs
  -chained record) + integration coverage of both endpoints. Suite now **28 tests, 106 assertions**.

**Why**
- SVG over PNG keeps the Docker image and CI free of the `gd`/`imagick` extension. The QR and XML follow the
  AEAT format faithfully but point at the pre-production host — Cuentia isn't a registered issuer, so real
  SOAP submission stays Phase D (out of scope), as the ADR says.

**Next**
- Open banking (GoCardless Bank Account Data) — real bank movement imports.

### 2026-07-06 — Entry 030: Invoices page — surfacing Verifactu in the UI
**Done**
- New **Invoices** page (React): issue an invoice (customer + dynamic lines with a live client-side total
  preview), see the list, and expand any row to reveal its **Verifactu fingerprint** (hash, the record it
  chains to, sealed timestamp). A **"Verify chain"** button calls `/api/invoices/verify` and shows a green
  "🔒 Chain intact · N records verified" badge (or an amber "broken at …" one). Added the route, the navbar
  link and full ES/EN strings. Frontend build green (604 modules).

**Why**
- The Verifactu engine (phases A–B) was API-only and therefore invisible to anyone opening the live app.
  This page makes the tamper-evident chain something a visitor can *see and operate* — the point of the
  feature for a portfolio.

**Next**
- Phase C: the invoice QR (to the AEAT) and XML export, embedded in this same page.

### 2026-07-06 — Entry 029: Verifactu invoicing — Phase B (tamper-evident hash chain)
**Done**
- Every issued invoice now generates an `InvoiceRecord` (Verifactu *registro de alta*) carrying a
  **SHA-256 fingerprint chained to the previous record** — the core anti-fraud mechanism. Added
  `VerifactuHasher` (canonical string + hash), `VerifactuChain` (integrity verifier), the record entity +
  repository, wired generation into `InvoiceService`, and a `GET /api/invoices/verify` endpoint; the
  invoice detail now returns its `verifactu` block (hash, previousHash, generatedAt). Added a `taxId` (NIF)
  to `User` as the fingerprint's issuer id. Migration `Version20260706083619`.
- Tests: `VerifactuChainTest` (determinism, chaining, tamper detection — both a mutated field and a
  resealed-but-unlinked record) + an end-to-end integration test (two invoices → `/verify` ok, count 2,
  chained, per-user isolation). Suite now **24 tests, 86 assertions**.

**Why**
- A field-mutation test failed *only on SQLite*: a `NUMERIC` `1210.00` read back as `1210`, so the
  fingerprint recomputed after a DB round-trip didn't match the sealed one (PostgreSQL returns `1210.00`,
  hiding it in the live check). Lesson banked: a cryptographic hash must never depend on how the database
  formats a value — amounts are now normalized to two decimals inside the canonical string.

**Next**
- Phase C: the invoice QR (to the AEAT) and the XML export.

### 2026-07-06 — Entry 028: Verifactu invoicing — Phase A (domain model)
**Done**
- Added the invoicing domain: `Customer`, `Invoice` and `InvoiceLine` entities (all scoped to a `User`),
  their repositories, an `InvoiceService` and an `InvoiceController` (`GET`/`POST /api/invoices`,
  `GET /api/invoices/{id}`). Migration `Version20260706075837` creates the three tables.
- Totals are computed in **integer cents** (never floats) and invoice numbers are **correlative per
  series** (`nextNumber = MAX(number)+1`) — both prerequisites for the Verifactu hash chain.
- Wrote [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-verifactu-invoicing.md) (scope A→D + honest monetization note) and
  [guide 24](guide/24-verifactu-invoicing.md). Added `InvoiceServiceTest` (totals/VAT/numbering + empty-lines
  guard): suite now **18 tests, 59 assertions**. Live check: one line @21 % + two @10 % → base 1100.00,
  VAT 220.00, total 1320.00, number 2026/1.

**Why**
- Verifactu (Orden HAC/1177/2024) becomes obligatory in 2026; getting ahead of it makes Cuentia a credible
  showcase. The domain model has to be right — cents-exact totals and gapless numbering — before the
  tamper-evident hash chain can sit on top of it.

**Next**
- Phase B: the `InvoiceRecord` with the chained SHA-256 hash and tamper-detection tests.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 027: Free hosting — Render + Neon (Railway trial expired)
**Done**
- Switched the deploy target to free tiers: **Render** (Docker web service) for the backend and **Neon**
  (PostgreSQL that doesn't pause) for the database; Vercel unchanged. Added `render.yaml` (blueprint).
- **Fixed a Dockerfile bug**: the Apache `$PORT` was substituted at build time (would be empty); now it's
  set at container start (`${PORT:-8080}`), so it works on Render/Koyeb/Fly/Railway.
- Updated the deploy guide (Render + Neon, cold-start note, Koyeb alternative).

**Why**
- The Railway trial expired and paying isn't an option; the Dockerfile being host-agnostic means only the
  hosting instructions changed, not the app.

**Next**
- Deploy on Render + Neon, then add the URL + screenshots to the README and pin the repo.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 026: Deploy configuration (Docker + Vercel)
**Done**
- Added `backend/Dockerfile` (Apache + PHP 8.4, runs migrations on boot), `public/.htaccess` (apache-pack),
  a `when@prod` framework config (trusted proxies + secure cookies), and `frontend/vercel.json` (SPA routing
  + `/api` proxy to the backend — so no CORS and first-party session cookies).
- Wrote a full deploy guide ([guide 23](guide/23-deploy.md)): PostgreSQL (Supabase/Railway), backend on
  Railway with env vars, `app:create-user` for the admin, frontend on Vercel, verification & troubleshooting.
- Tests still green (16), dev app unaffected.

**Why**
- The frontend→backend proxy avoids the classic cross-domain cookie/CORS pain and keeps the setup simple.
  Configs are prepared and documented; the actual cloud deploy is done from the user's accounts.

**Next**
- Go live (create the accounts, deploy), then add the URL + screenshots to the README and pin the repo.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 025: API integration tests
**Done**
- Added `tests/Api/ApiIntegrationTest` (WebTestCase): boots the real kernel/firewall/DB and tests register/
  login/me/logout, 401 for unauthenticated, duplicate-email 409, **per-user isolation** (A imports 2, B sees
  0), and clear/delete account.
- Runs on **SQLite in-memory** (`.env.test`) with `disableReboot()` — no DB service needed; CI installs
  `pdo_sqlite`.
- Caught two real bugs: `transaction` is a reserved word in SQLite (fixed by quoting the table name), and
  Windows SQLite file-locking (fixed with the in-memory DB). `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (16 tests, 52 assertions)**.
  Documented in [guide 22](guide/22-integration-tests.md).

**Why**
- Integration tests prove the whole stack is wired correctly — the strongest evidence, for an interviewer,
  that the app really works.

**Next**
- The live deployment.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 024: UX polish — liquid-glass redesign + responsive
**Done**
- Reworked `index.css` into a "liquid glass" system (iOS/WhatsApp-inspired): translucent frosted cards and
  a floating rounded navbar (`backdrop-filter`), pill buttons/inputs, a tinted background, and WhatsApp-style
  chat bubbles (accent user bubble, asymmetric radii). Light + dark tokens.
- Responsive: navbar wraps, charts stack, tables scroll horizontally (`.table-scroll`) on mobile.
- All via tokens/classes — components unchanged. Build passes. Documented in [guide 21](guide/21-ux-glass.md).

**Why**
- A cohesive, modern finish across light/dark and desktop/mobile is what makes the project *feel*
  professional at a glance.

**Next**
- API integration tests, then deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 023: Account & GDPR (clear data / delete account)
**Done**
- Added `AccountController`: `POST /api/account/clear` (delete the user's transactions) and
  `DELETE /api/account` (delete the account + data, invalidate the session — right to erasure).
- Added an Account page (`/account`, via the email in the navbar) with clear-data, delete-account (danger)
  and a privacy note; `AuthContext.deleteAccount()`. ES/EN.
- Verified: clear 15→0; delete account → session invalidated. Documented in [guide 20](guide/20-account-gdpr.md).

**Why**
- Real accounts need a way out (GDPR), and "clear my data" is a handy reset for the live demo — both cheap
  thanks to the per-user data isolation.

**Next**
- UX & responsive polish, API integration tests, then deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 022: Demo data + user/admin CLI (polish)
**Done**
- Added `POST /api/demo/load`: loads 2 months of realistic sample movements for the current user (only if
  empty) by reusing the real import + categorization pipeline, so a fresh account is never empty.
- Added a "Load sample data" button to the Movements empty state (ES/EN).
- Added `app:create-user` console command (with `--admin`) to create accounts/admins for a deployment.
- Verified: created an admin; a fresh user loads 15 movements (2 months, 8 categories, VAT computed).
  Documented in [guide 19](guide/19-demo-and-admin.md).

**Why**
- Going public: the biggest demo-killer is an empty screen. Sample data (through the real pipeline) makes
  the app instantly explorable; the CLI safely seeds server accounts.

**Next**
- Account & GDPR (delete/clear), UX & responsive polish, API integration tests, then deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entry 021: Authentication & multi-user (Phase 4)
**Done**
- Added a `User` entity + Symfony security-bundle: entity provider, session `json_login`, logout, access
  control. Endpoints: `POST /api/register`, `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `GET /api/me`.
- Scoped everything to the current user: `Transaction` now belongs to a `User`; imports set it;
  `TransactionRepository::findForUser()`; every service and the stats SQL filter by user (passed via
  `#[CurrentUser]`).
- Frontend: `AuthContext` + a login/register `AuthPage`; `App` gates the whole app; navbar shows the email
  + logout.
- Updated all unit tests to the new signatures. `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (11 tests, 37 assertions)**.
  Verified end to end with session cookies (register → login → scoped data → 401 when logged out).
  Documented in [guide 18](guide/18-auth.md).

**Why**
- Multi-user data isolation is what turns this from a demo into a real SaaS — and enforcing it at the query
  layer is the correct, secure way.

**Next**
- Production hardening + the live deploy.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 020: Natural-language assistant (AI + fallback)
**Done**
- Added `ChatService`: builds a factual context (balance, income/expenses, top categories, VAT, next IRPF
  payment) and asks Claude to answer using only it; deterministic **data-summary fallback** without a key.
- Added `POST /api/chat` and an **Assistant** page (`/chat`) with a chat UI; added the navbar link and ES/EN
  translations. Wired into the app.
- Added `ChatServiceTest` (fallback path). `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (11 tests, 37 assertions)**. Documented
  in [guide 17](guide/17-chat.md).

**Why**
- Natural-language Q&A grounded on the user's own data is the flagship AI feature — and the fallback keeps
  it honest and always usable.

**Next**
- Phase 4: authentication/multi-user, then the live deploy.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 019: Cash-flow forecast (Phase 3 begins)
**Done**
- Added `ForecastService` (linear projection of the balance at +30/60/90 days from the average daily net)
  and `GET /api/forecast`.
- Added a `Forecast` line chart on the Dashboard (current balance + avg. monthly net tiles + an
  "estimate" note). Wired `/api/forecast` into `useFinanceData`.
- Added `ForecastServiceTest`. `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (10 tests, 33 assertions)**. Documented in
  [guide 16](guide/16-forecast.md).

**Why**
- A forward-looking number is what a freelancer actually worries about ("will I make it?"), and a
  transparent, clearly-labeled model keeps it honest.

**Next**
- Natural-language questions over the transactions (AI), then auth + deploy.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 018: Norma 43 importer (Phase 2 complete)
**Done**
- Added `ImportService::importNorma43()` — parses the fixed-width AEB Cuaderno 43 format (record 22 =
  movement, 23 = concept), and an `import()` dispatcher that **auto-detects** CSV vs Norma 43 by content.
- The same upload endpoint/button now handles both; the file input accepts `.csv` and `.n43`.
- Added `ImportServiceTest` (CSV + Norma 43, built from 80-char records). `php bin/phpunit` →
  **OK (8 tests, 25 assertions)**. Verified end to end with a sample `.n43` (4 movements imported).
  Documented in [guide 15](guide/15-norma43.md). **Phase 2 is complete.**

**Why**
- Norma 43 is what every Spanish bank exports; parsing it (and salaries/VAT correctly) is the domain
  depth that differentiates the project.

**Next**
- Phase 3 (cash-flow forecast, NL chat, open banking) or preparing the live deploy.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 017: Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)
**Done**
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with two parallel jobs: **backend** (PHP 8.4 → `composer install` →
  `php bin/phpunit`) and **frontend** (Node 24 → `npm ci` → `npm run build`).
- Added a CI status badge (+ stack badges) to the README.

**Why**
- Running the tests and build on every push prevents regressions from being merged, and the green badge
  is instant credibility for anyone browsing the repo.

**Next**
- A live deployment with a link and screenshots in the README.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 016: Unit tests for the finance logic (PHPUnit)
**Done**
- Installed PHPUnit (`symfony/test-pack`).
- Added `VatServiceTest` and `IrpfServiceTest`: pure unit tests that build Transaction/Category objects in
  memory and feed them via a **stub** repository (no DB). Assert VAT (336/23/313), IRPF Q1 payment 230.64,
  salary excluded, and the next-deadline countdown.
- `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (6 tests, 14 assertions)**, no notices (used `createStub` per PHPUnit 13).
  Documented in [guide 13](guide/13-testing.md).

**Why**
- The tax logic is where a bug costs the most; testing it proves correctness, guards against regressions,
  and is a strong interview talking point.

**Next**
- CI (GitHub Actions running the tests) + a live deploy, or the Norma 43 importer.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 015: Internationalization (ES/EN toggle)
**Done**
- Added a dependency-free i18n: a translations dictionary (en/es), a `LanguageContext` with `useTranslation()`
  (`{ lang, setLang, t }`), and an EN/ES toggle button in the navbar. Choice persists in localStorage.
- Replaced hardcoded UI strings across navbar, pages, charts and tax panels with `t('key')`; `t()`
  supports `{param}` placeholders (e.g. the IRPF deadline alert, quarter prefix Q/T).
- Default language Spanish; switches instantly. Documented in [guide 12](guide/12-i18n.md).

**Why**
- A bilingual UI signals international product thinking and showcases the author's ES/EN profile — a
  strong fit for remote/EU roles.

**Next**
- Norma 43 importer (finish Phase 2), then production concerns (tests, auth, deploy).

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 014: Visual redesign (design tokens, no "AI look")
**Done**
- Replaced the template CSS (purple accent) with a **design-token system** in `index.css`: surfaces, ink,
  one brand blue, semantic money colors, radii, shadows — plus a full **dark theme**.
- Refactored every component/page to **class names** reading the tokens (`.card`, `.btn`, `.table`,
  `.tag`, `.navbar`, `.stat-value`, `.alert-warn`…). Charts read `--chart-*` at runtime to follow the theme.
- Sober, financial styling (hairline borders, subtle shadows, tabular figures) — deliberately not the
  flashy AI-template look. Documented in [guide 11](guide/11-visual-redesign.md).

**Why**
- With all the functionality in place, a clean professional look is what turns "functional" into
  "impressive" for a recruiter.

**Next**
- Internationalization: an ES/EN language toggle.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 013: Frontend split into pages + navbar (React Router)
**Done**
- Added React Router: a `Layout` (navbar + `<Outlet/>`) that loads data once via `useFinanceData()` and
  shares it with pages through the Outlet context.
- Split the single page into **Movements** (`/`), **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) and **Taxes** (`/taxes`).
- Extracted shared helpers (`lib/format`, `components/Stat`). Verified all routes return 200 (SPA
  fallback) and the API proxy still works. Documented in [guide 10](guide/10-frontend-routing.md).

**Why**
- A real multi-page SPA structure is cleaner, scalable and what a recruiter expects — and it sets the
  stage for the visual redesign.

**Next**
- Visual redesign: a clean, professional look that doesn't look AI-generated.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 012: IRPF estimate (modelo 130) + deadline alert
**Done**
- Added `IrpfService` (reuses `VatService::baseCents()`): cumulative 20% of year-to-date net
  (self-employment income − deductible expenses, without VAT), salary excluded, per-quarter with
  official deadlines and a "next deadline" countdown.
- Added `GET /api/irpf` and an IRPF panel (quarter table + a warning banner when a deadline is < 30 days).
- Verified: Q1 net 1153.21 → payment 230.64; next deadline Q2 2026-07-20 (18 days). Documented in
  [guide 09](guide/09-irpf.md).

**Why**
- IRPF + VAT together tell a complete tax story — the core value for a Spanish freelancer and the
  clearest demonstration of the finance moat.

**Next**
- Norma 43 import, then the frontend redesign.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 011: VAT panel (Phase 2 begins)
**Done**
- Added `VatService` (category → Spanish VAT-rate map, cents-based VAT extraction) and `GET /api/vat`.
- Added a VAT summary panel in React: output VAT, input VAT and net (to pay / to reclaim).
- Verified on the sample data: output 336.00, input 23.00, net 313.00 to pay — salary and autónomo fee
  correctly carry no VAT. Documented in [guide 08](guide/08-vat-panel.md).

**Why**
- This is the finance moat: computing VAT correctly (right rates per category, salaries exempt, exact
  cents) is exactly the domain knowledge that differentiates this project.

**Next**
- IRPF estimate (modelo 130) and quarterly deadline alerts.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 010: Dashboard with charts
**Done**
- Added `GET /api/stats` (raw SQL aggregation: totals, spending by category, income/expenses by month).
- Added a `Dashboard` React component (Recharts): a single-hue horizontal bar for category spending and a
  two-series bar for monthly income vs expenses. Colors chosen by the data-viz method and **validated**
  with the skill's script (CVD ΔE 74.6). Charts refresh on import/categorize.
- Documented in [guide 07](guide/07-dashboard.md).

**Why**
- This is the most "sellable" screen: at a glance you see where the money goes — the payoff of the
  import + categorization work.

**Next**
- Phase 2: the VAT panel (output vs input VAT, net due) — the finance moat.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 009: AI categorization (with rule fallback)
**Done**
- Added `CategorizerService`: a fixed category list, a deterministic Spanish keyword rule engine, and an
  optional Claude call (via HttpClient) that is validated against the allowed list.
- Added `POST /api/transactions/categorize` and a "🧠 Categorize" button + Category column in React.
- Verified with no API key: 8/8 categorized correctly by rules (Mercadona→Supermercado,
  Repsol→Combustible, Nómina→Nómina, etc.). Documented in [guide 06](guide/06-ai-categorization.md).

**Why**
- Categorization is what turns a raw list into insight. Keeping AI optional (rule fallback) means the app
  always works and stays honest — a deliberate architecture principle.

**Next**
- Dashboard: spending by category and by month (Recharts), then the VAT panel (Phase 2).

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 008: List transactions (visible end-to-end loop)
**Done**
- Added `GET /api/transactions` (maps entities to a plain DTO array, ordered by date).
- Rebuilt the React `App.jsx`: a transactions table (euro formatting, red/green by sign), an
  income/expenses/balance summary, and a file input that uploads a CSV (FormData) and refreshes.
- Verified: the endpoint returns 8 rows through the Vite proxy and the frontend builds cleanly.
  Documented in [guide 05](guide/05-list-transactions.md).

**Why**
- First fully visible loop: upload a CSV → see your movements. It turns the backend work into something
  a person (or a recruiter) can actually see.

**Next**
- AI categorization: assign a category to each transaction with Claude + a rule-based fallback.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 007: CSV import
**Done**
- Added `ImportService` (parses a bank CSV) and `POST /api/import/csv` (thin controller).
- The parser auto-detects the `,`/`;` separator, maps bilingual columns, and handles the Spanish
  number format (`1.234,56`) — keeping money as an exact decimal string.
- Added a sample file and verified end to end: imported 8 rows (balance 3316.21), 0 errors, accents
  preserved. Documented in [guide 04](guide/04-csv-import.md).

**Why**
- This is the first tangible value: a real bank export becomes structured data. Keeping the finance
  parsing correct (Spanish decimals, no float) is the differentiator.

**Next**
- Expose the transactions via an API endpoint and render them in the React frontend.

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 006: Database + domain model (Phase 1 begins)
**Done**
- Installed Doctrine (`symfony/orm-pack`) and MakerBundle.
- Started local PostgreSQL (`pg_ctl`), configured `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`, created the `cuentia`
  database.
- Wrote the `Category` and `Transaction` entities (+ repositories); generated and ran the first
  migration. Tables `category` and `transaction` now exist.
- Documented it in [guide 03](guide/03-database-and-entities.md). Decided to use auto-increment
  integer IDs for now (simpler than UUID); updated ARCHITECTURE accordingly.

**Why**
- The entities are the backbone of the app. Getting money right from day one (`decimal`, not float)
  avoids a whole class of accounting bugs.

**Next**
- CSV import: an endpoint that parses a bank CSV and stores `Transaction` rows (guide 04).

### 2026-07-02 — Entry 005: React frontend + Phase 0 complete
**Done**
- Scaffolded the React app (Vite) in `frontend/`; added a dev **proxy** (`/api` → `:8000`) to avoid CORS.
- `App.jsx` calls `GET /api/health` on mount and shows "✅ API OK".
- Verified end to end: with both servers running, `http://localhost:5173/api/health` is proxied to the
  backend and returns the JSON. **Phase 0 is complete.**
- Documented it in [guide 02](guide/02-frontend-scaffold.md), including the real `localhost` vs
  `127.0.0.1` (IPv6) gotcha we hit.

**Why**
- Proving the frontend↔backend link now, on the simplest possible feature, means every later feature
  is built on a foundation we know works.

**Next**
- Phase 1: domain model (`Transaction`, `Category`), PostgreSQL via Doctrine, and CSV import (guide 03).

### 2026-07-01 — Entry 004: Backend scaffold + first green
**Done**
- Scaffolded the Symfony 8.1 API in `backend/` (`symfony new backend`); removed its nested `.git`
  to keep a single monorepo.
- Added `HealthController` with `GET /api/health`; verified it returns
  `{"status":"ok","service":"cuentia-api"}` via a local server.
- Documented the whole thing in the teaching [`guide/`](guide/) (00-environment, 01-backend-scaffold).

**Why**
- A health endpoint is the smallest possible proof that the request→controller→response chain works —
  the right first milestone before adding a database or features.

**Next**
- Scaffold the React frontend (Vite) and have it call `/api/health` (guide 02).

### 2026-07-01 — Entry 003: Repo published + toolchain installed
**Done**
- Created and pushed the public repo: **github.com/R0b3r7DEV/cuentia** (first commit = docs).
- Installed the backend toolchain via Scoop: **PHP 8.5.7**, **Composer 2.10.2**,
  **Symfony CLI 5.17.1**, **PostgreSQL 18.4** (cluster initialized; local `trust` auth).
- Created a `php.ini` enabling the extensions Symfony needs: `pdo_pgsql`, `pgsql`, `intl`,
  `mbstring`, `openssl`, `curl`, `fileinfo`, `sodium`, `zip`.

**Why**
- Building in public from commit 1 tells a strong story; a fully working local toolchain unblocks Phase 0.

**Next**
- Scaffold the Symfony API and the React app; first green `GET /api/health` → 200.

### 2026-07-01 — Entry 002: Bilingual documentation
**Done:** made all docs bilingual (English first, Spanish below).
**Why:** the author uses the docs in Spanish while learning, and recruiters read the English.
**Next:** same as entry 001 — install tooling and scaffold.

### 2026-07-01 — Entry 001: Project decided, foundations laid
**Done**
- Chose the project and stack (see [ADR 0002](decisions/0002-project-and-stack.md)):
  *Cuentia*, an AI cash-flow & tax copilot, built on **Symfony + React + PostgreSQL + Claude**.
- Created the documentation skeleton: README, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, ADR 0001, ADR 0002, this dev log.
- Defined the initial domain model (`Transaction`, `Category`) and the phased roadmap.

**Why**
- Starting with the *why* written down (ADRs) and a phased plan keeps the build focused and makes
  every decision defensible later — which is the whole point of this project.

**Next**
- Install backend tooling: PHP, Composer, Symfony CLI, PostgreSQL (Phase 0).
- Scaffold the Symfony API and the React app; get a `GET /api/health` returning 200.

### 2026-07-11 — Entrada 049: Partes de trabajo — el día a día del electricista (P1, backend)
**Hecho (P1 del [PLAN-v2](../PLAN-v2.md), PR de backend)**
- Entidades `WorkOrder` + `WorkOrderLine`: cliente, título, descripción, estado
  (`pendiente→en_curso→terminado→facturado`), fecha programada, mano de obra (horas × precio + IVA) y líneas
  de material en céntimos enteros. Solo tablas nuevas — la cadena de hash de facturas queda intacta.
- `WorkOrderService::convert()` reutiliza `QuoteService::convert()` **igual**: el enlace `convertedInvoice`
  lo hace idempotente (convertir dos veces ⇒ misma factura). Materiales → líneas; mano de obra → una línea
  "Mano de obra (N h)". Se emite por `InvoiceService::create()`, así que hereda numeración sin huecos + el
  registro de la cadena y respeta el modo de facturación (ADR 0004).
- `WorkOrderController`: CRUD + `/convert`, todo acotado al usuario; un parte facturado es inmutable (409).
- Tests: `WorkOrderServiceTest` + un test de integración que **convierte dos veces y comprueba una sola
  factura** (total = materiales + mano de obra), aislamiento e inmutabilidad. 91 tests, 401 aserciones.

**Siguiente**
- P1 PR2 — UI móvil, fotos y firma del cliente.

### 2026-07-11 — Entrada 048: Modo dual de facturación — facturas reales por defecto, Verifactu como demo
**Qué pasaba**
- Toda factura llevaba un **QR del host de pruebas** de la AEAT y una leyenda «Verifactu», porque
  `InvoiceService` siempre escribe un registro y el PDF imprimía el QR cuando existía. Una factura real del
  piloto para su cliente saldría con un QR de preproducción. Mal para uso real.

**Hecho (P0 del [PLAN-v2](../PLAN-v2.md))**
- `User.billingMode` por usuario (`standard` por defecto / `verifactu` demo) + perfil fiscal del emisor
  (`businessName`, `fiscalAddress`) para que una factura estándar **RD 1619/2012** esté completa. La
  migración rellena las filas existentes a `standard`.
- `InvoicePdf::build(..., bool $showVerifactu)`: QR + leyenda solo en demo; el PDF estándar es una factura
  ordinaria. `/qr` y `/xml` devuelven **403** en modo estándar.
- **La cadena de hash vive en ambos modos.** La huella no incluye el modo, así que cambiar de modo nunca
  rompe `GET /api/invoices/verify` sobre facturas preexistentes — comprobado con un test de regresión.
- UI de cuenta: selector de modo en lenguaje claro + formulario de emisor; la UI de facturas oculta
  QR/XML/cadena en estándar y muestra un aviso DEMO en Verifactu. En español, no técnico.
- Fecha de obligación verificada contra el BOE: autónomos desde el **1 de julio de 2027** (RD-ley 15/2025);
  opcional en 2026. Ver [ADR 0004](../decisions/0004-dual-billing-mode.md),
  [guía 38](guide/38-dual-billing-mode.md).
- 85 tests, 379 aserciones.

**Siguiente**
- P1 — partes de trabajo.

### 2026-07-10 — Entrada 047: El plano se comprueba contra la ITC-BT-25, y de él sale el cuadro
**Qué pasaba**
- El diseñador calculaba los puntos mínimos por estancia **y luego los ignoraba**. Podías dibujar una cocina
  con tres enchufes, exportarla y generar el CIE. La promesa central del producto estaba sin cumplir.
- Peor: los propios mínimos eran una aproximación inventada. Descargué la
  [GUÍA-BT-25](https://industria.gob.es/Calidad-Industrial/seguridadindustrial/instalacionesindustriales/baja-tension/Documents/bt/guia_bt_25_jul12R2.pdf)
  del Ministerio, parseé el PDF y leí la **tabla 2**. Cinco desviaciones — ver
  [guía 37](guide/37-itc-bt-25-compliance-and-panel.md).

**Hecho**
- `roomRequirements()` **es** ya la tabla 2: las nueve tomas de la cocina repartidas en cuatro circuitos, el
  suelo de "3 tomas o una por cada 6 m², lo que sea mayor", los pasillos regidos por **longitud** y no por
  superficie, y una terraza que no lleva enchufe.
- Corregido el grado: más de cinco circuitos exige **un diferencial adicional**, no electrificación elevada
  ("no supondrá el paso a electrificación elevada", 2.3.1). Subíamos la potencia contratada de 5 750 W a
  9 200 W sin motivo — una factura real para el cliente. Implementados los ocho supuestos verdaderos.
- Cada toma declara el circuito que la alimenta (C2/C3/C4/C5/C10). La que no lo declara se imputa a lo que
  su estancia aún necesite; la que declara el circuito equivocado, no.
- `validateLayout()` imputa dispositivos por **punto en polígono**, mide las estancias con el **teorema del
  zapatero** (un salón en L cuenta por su superficie real) y nombra cada carencia. **El botón de crear el
  CIE se deshabilita** mientras el plano no llegue.
- `panelSchedule()` dibuja el **cuadro general (CGMP)** con los dispositivos realmente colocados: circuitos
  dimensionados por los puntos conectados, desdoblados al máximo de la tabla 1, IGA según la potencia
  contratada, un diferencial por cada cinco circuitos y módulos DIN contados para poder pedir el envolvente.

**Por qué así**
- Los dos lectores comparten un único `tally()` privado. Contar dos veces acabaría haciendo que la
  comprobación y el cuadro discrepasen sobre lo instalado — un fallo infernal de perseguir.
- Un plano vacío informa `checked: false`: **sin comprobar, no conforme**. Un validador que dice "OK" a una
  entrada vacía es peor que no tener validador.
- La app dice sin rodeos que un plano solo puede demostrar el *número de puntos de utilización*. Secciones,
  tierras y mediciones quedan fuera de un dibujo. **Ningún software puede prometer que un certificado no
  será devuelto**; lo que se cierra es la familia de rechazos más común.

**Siguiente**
- Tests de frontend (no hay ninguno) — empezando por la geometría y la homografía.

### 2026-07-10 — Entrada 046: El plano real debajo, enderezado; estancias como polígonos; plano descargable
**Hecho**
- El plano escaneado va bajo el editor 2D, con su escala calibrada contra una cota conocida.
- **Rectificación de cuatro puntos.** Una foto de móvil sale girada y con perspectiva, y una calibración de
  dos puntos no la salva: solo recupera la *escala*, y un metro sigue midiendo distinto en cada zona de la
  hoja. El usuario marca las cuatro esquinas; resolvemos la **homografía** por eliminación gaussiana y
  remapeamos con muestreo bilineal. Verificado: las esquinas caen con error de 1e-13 px y las rectas siguen
  rectas.
- Un cuadrilátero cruzado o casi plano todavía da un sistema **resoluble** mientras colapsa la imagen, así
  que la convexidad se comprueba aparte. La primera versión de ese guardián dejaba pasar tres puntos
  colineales: un producto cruzado exactamente cero no es ni positivo ni negativo.
- Las estancias son **polígonos**: un salón en L, un pasillo. Arrastra el punto medio de un lado para crear
  un vértice. Mover una estancia arrastra los dispositivos que contiene.
- El plano acabado se descarga en **PNG** con fondo, áreas, dispositivos, leyenda y escala.
- Navegación reagrupada: un único menú *Panel*; Certificados e Instalación pasan a rutas propias.
- Endurecido para producción: un fondo rechazado devolvía **200 con `background: null`** y el usuario veía
  desaparecer su plano calcado. Ahora falla en voz alta con un código estable. Y el contenedor ya no se traga
  los errores de migración con `|| true`: servir tráfico contra un esquema que no cuadra es justo como un
  login acaba en 500.

### 2026-07-09 — Entrada 045: Se rompió el login en producción — migración ausente, guardián de CI y errores de auth mejores
**Qué pasó**
- El login (y el registro) devolvían **500 en producción**. No era la contraseña: `/api/health` respondía
  bien, pero un login con credenciales falsas daba 500 en vez de 401. Causa: la función BYOK añadió tres
  columnas cifradas a `app_user`, **pero la migración nunca se generó** — `make:migration` había fallado en
  silencio porque el PostgreSQL local estaba caído, y solo revisé la salida de los tests. Doctrine
  consultaba entonces columnas inexistentes en la base de datos de producción.
- **Por qué los tests no lo cazaron:** el esquema de test se construye desde los *metadatos de las
  entidades* (SchemaTool sobre SQLite en memoria), nunca desde las *migraciones*. 59 tests en verde con la
  base de datos rota. Un punto ciego real.

**Arreglado**
- Confirmado el desajuste con `doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql`, generada y aplicada la migración que
  faltaba (`Version20260709094713`, tres columnas nullable — segura sobre filas existentes), push; Render la
  aplicó al arrancar. Verificado contra producción: el login responde ya **401**, no 500.

**El arreglo de verdad — un guardián en CI**
- Nuevo job **«Migrations (schema in sync)»**: levanta un PostgreSQL real, ejecuta **todas las migraciones
  desde cero** y luego `doctrine:schema:validate`. Si una entidad cambia sin su migración, **el CI se pone
  en rojo** antes de llegar a producción. Es justo la clase de fallo que los tests unitarios no pueden ver.

**Además: errores de autenticación profesionales**
- Los fallos llevan ahora un `code` estable que el frontend traduce: `bad_credentials`, `email_taken`,
  `invalid_email`, `weak_password`, `too_many_attempts`, más los casos de servidor/red. Un
  `AuthenticationFailureHandler` propio devuelve JSON limpio. **El login sigue siendo genérico a propósito**
  — el mismo 401 exista o no la cuenta, para que nadie pueda enumerar emails registrados; un test comprueba
  que ambas respuestas son idénticas. Contraseña mínima subida a 8 caracteres (solo en el registro, para no
  romper cuentas existentes). Suite: **60 tests, 273 aserciones**.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 044: Integraciones "trae tu propia clave" (cifradas, por usuario)
**Hecho**
- Los usuarios pueden activar la IA y la banca abierta desde **Cuenta → Integraciones** pegando sus
  **propias** claves — sin variables de entorno. Las claves van **cifradas en reposo** (`SecretCipher`,
  AES-256-GCM desde el secreto de la app) y nunca se devuelven al cliente (el estado solo muestra
  configurada + pista enmascarada). `CredentialStore` resuelve las claves por usuario con fallback a env;
  refactorizados `ChatService`, `CategorizerService`, `GoCardlessClient` (ahora `configure()` por petición),
  `OpenBankingService` y `BankController` para leer a través de él. Nuevos endpoints de cuenta + sección en
  la UI de Cuenta. Migración con tres columnas cifradas en `User`. Suite: **58 tests, 250 aserciones**
  (round-trip/manipulación del cifrado + test BYOK end-to-end donde guardar GoCardless activa
  `/api/bank/status` para ese usuario).

**Por qué**
- Las funciones dependían de variables de entorno que un usuario final no puede tocar. BYOK las hace
  autoservicio y honestas (la clave de cada uno), manteniendo la seguridad — secretos cifrados, nunca
  devueltos.

**Siguiente**
- La IA agéntica + OCR podrían construirse ya sobre la clave propia de Claude del usuario.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 043: Navbar en móvil — iconos en vez de nombres
**Hecho**
- Arreglado el navbar que se salía/solapaba en el móvil. Cada elemento tiene ahora icono + etiqueta: en
  escritorio se ve la **etiqueta** (aspecto igual) y en móvil (≤820px) solo el **icono**. El email largo se
  reduce a un icono 👤 y salir a 🚪, así todo cabe en una fila compacta. Ajustados los paddings móviles y el
  tamaño de la marca de agua. Solo frontend/CSS.

**Por qué**
- En el móvil los cinco nombres + el email completo + tres botones se envolvían y se solapaban; los iconos
  lo mantienen legible y pequeño sin tocar el escritorio.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 042: Diseñador de instalación — Fase 3 (vista 3D de la planta)
**Hecho**
- `FloorPlan3D` (react-three-fiber): levanta la planta 2D a paredes semitransparentes, coloca los
  dispositivos a alturas realistas (enchufe 0.3 / interruptor 1.1 / luz 2.4 emisiva / cuadro 1.2 m) y el
  cuadro, con suelo + rejilla y **OrbitControls** (girar/zoom/mover). Lee el mismo `layout` que el editor
  2D. Va **cargado en diferido** tras un botón «Ver en 3D» — el build confirma que se separa en su propio
  chunk (`FloorPlan3D-*.js` ≈ 900 kB), así que Three.js solo se descarga bajo demanda y el bundle principal
  no cambia. Añadidos `three` + `@react-three/fiber@9` + `@react-three/drei@10` (compatibles con React 19).
  Sin cambios de backend.

**Por qué**
- Es la Fase 3 del diseñador (enfoque B): un modelo 2D útil con una capa de presentación 3D opcional. El
  flujo del electricista ya corre diseño → plano 2D → vista 3D → CIE → presupuesto → factura.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR (necesitan una key de Anthropic). El diseñador podría ganar 3D texturizado/primera
  persona, pero eso es otro producto.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 041: Diseñador de instalación — Fase 2 (editor 2D de planta)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `FloorPlanEditor`: un lienzo SVG de planta (rejilla métrica) donde las estancias son rectángulos
  arrastrables y el cuadro + dispositivos (enchufe/interruptor/luz) se colocan con herramienta + clic y se
  arrastran con Mover (Borrar quita). Un botón **Auto-colocar** siembra el plano desde el diseño y coloca
  los puntos ITC-BT-25 de cada estancia como dispositivos. `InstallationCalculator::layoutCable()` mide el
  cable como el recorrido Manhattan de cada dispositivo al cuadro (+bajada, +10 % holgura), así que la UI
  muestra **«Cable según plano: N m»** en vez de la estimación cuando hay planta. La planta se persiste como
  columna JSON en `Installation` (migración); `/compute` acepta `layout`. Suite: **55 tests, 244 aserciones**.

**Por qué**
- La Fase 1 daba una estimación por superficie; una planta real da metros reales y un croquis que el
  electricista puede entregar. El mismo modelo se extruirá a 3D en la Fase 3.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 3 (3D extruido paseable). La IA agéntica + OCR siguen necesitando una key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 040: Cerrar el círculo — diseño → CIE y diseño → presupuesto
**Hecho**
- Enganchado el diseñador de instalación con el resto del módulo de facturación (solo frontend). Desde un
  diseño calculado, dos botones: **«Crear certificado (CIE)»** prellena el formulario de Certificados con
  los datos técnicos (potencia→kW, tensión, suministro, tierra TT, circuitos, IGA 25/40 A, diferencial 30
  mA); **«Materiales → presupuesto»** abre el formulario de Presupuestos con una línea por material.
  Añadido el paso de datos entre pestañas en `BillingPage` (una pestaña entrega datos a otra; al pulsar una
  pestaña manualmente se limpia). Sin placeholders: el usuario completa cliente/identidad donde toca.

**Por qué**
- Es el diferencial que venía señalando: **diseño → CIE → presupuesto → factura** en una sola herramienta,
  cada paso alimentando el siguiente. Los datos que el electricista introdujo una vez fluyen por toda la
  cadena.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 2 (plano 2D) / Fase 3 (3D) del diseñador. La IA agéntica + OCR siguen necesitando una key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 039: Diseñador de instalación — Fase 1 (calculadora ITC-BT-25 + esquema unifilar)
**Hecho**
- Nueva pestaña **Instalación**: una calculadora del REBT **ITC-BT-25**. `InstallationCalculator` (puro,
  con tests) convierte estancias + cargas previstas en circuitos (C1–C12 con sección/PIA, desdoblando en
  C6/C7 al superar los límites de puntos), puntos mínimos por estancia, grado y potencia a contratar,
  diferenciales, lista de materiales y estimación de cable. `InstallationController` expone un `/compute` sin
  estado más CRUD para guardar diseños (entidad `Installation`, columnas JSON; el resultado se recalcula
  desde la entrada guardada). El frontend recalcula en vivo y dibuja un **esquema unifilar (SVG)** + tablas
  de circuitos/puntos/materiales. Migración añadida. Suite: **52 tests, 233 aserciones**.
- Basado en la ITC-BT-25 (5 circuitos básico, 9+ elevado; un diferencial por cada 5 circuitos; puntos
  mínimos por estancia). Enfoque honesto: ayuda de predimensionado; el cable es estimación; no es proyecto
  firmado.

**Por qué**
- Aquí empieza la cadena diseño → CIE → presupuesto → factura del electricista. Es la Fase 1 del diseñador
  (enfoque B); Fase 2 = editor 2D de planta, Fase 3 = vista 3D extruida.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 2 (plano 2D), autorrellenar el CIE desde un diseño, materiales → presupuesto. La IA agéntica + OCR
  siguen necesitando una key.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 038: CIE — presentable de verdad (listo para firmar + AutoFirma)
**Hecho**
- Llevado el CIE de "borrador" a **listo para firmar**. Investigada la tramitación telemática de la GVA: los
  documentos deben ir en **PDF firmado digitalmente** (DNIe / FNMT / ACCV / Cl@ve-firma) y los presenta el
  instalador habilitado en la sede — **no hay API de terceros**. Elegido el camino seguro (contigo): Cuentia
  nunca maneja el certificado del instalador.
- Mejorado `CiePdf` a un documento CERTINS E completo: declaración de conformidad íntegra (RD 842/2002 +
  ITC-BT, mediciones favorables), *lugar y fecha* y **áreas reservadas de firma electrónica** para empresa e
  instalador ("firma electrónica AutoFirma/ACCV"). Añadido un panel in-app **«Cómo firmarlo y presentarlo»**
  (descargar → firmar con AutoFirma/ACCV → presentar en la sede de la GVA) con enlaces oficiales.

**Por qué**
- "Presentable de verdad" = documento fiel + firma real + presentación. La firma la hace el instalador en
  local (la clave privada nunca sale de su equipo, como recomienda la GVA); la presentación no tiene API
  pública, así que sigue siendo su subida manual — el mismo límite honesto que el envío real a la AEAT de
  Verifactu.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR — ambas necesitan una API key de Anthropic.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 037: Certificado de Instalación Eléctrica (CIE / CERTINS E)
**Hecho**
- Investigado el CIE de la Comunitat Valenciana y confirmado un modelo oficial — **CERTINS E (12/2012)**,
  que se presenta telemáticamente con firma digital en la sede de la GVA. Implementada una entidad
  **Certificate** + CRUD `CertificateController` + `CiePdf` (PDF con estructura CERTINS E vía Dompdf) + una
  pestaña **Certificados** en Facturación. Los campos siguen el REBT (RD 842/2002): instalación, titular,
  empresa instaladora/instalador y características técnicas (potencia, tensión, suministro, tierra, IGA,
  diferencial, etc.). Migración añadida.
- Enfoque honesto (nota del formulario + pie del PDF): es un **borrador de ayuda**, no la presentación
  oficial telemática y firmada. Tests: CRUD, validación, PDF, aislamiento por usuario. Suite: **45 tests,
  192 aserciones**. Guía 32. (Corregidos dos bugs que cazaron los tests: lectura de clave indefinida en un
  `installationType` sin definir, y usar null como índice de array en el PDF.)

**Por qué**
- Un plus real para un electricista que use la app: el CIE es el documento que emite en cada trabajo, y
  reutilizar los datos que ya guarda para facturar elimina reescribir.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR — ambas necesitan una API key de Anthropic.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 036: Presupuestos + convertir en factura
**Hecho**
- Añadidos los **presupuestos**: entidades `Quote`/`QuoteLine` (no fiscales, sin cadena de hash),
  `QuoteService`, `QuoteController` (`list/create/get/status/convert/pdf`), `QuotePdf`, migración, y una
  pestaña **Presupuestos** (crear con cliente + líneas del catálogo + *válido hasta*, insignia de estado,
  acciones por fila). Lo principal: **convertir** copia el presupuesto a `InvoiceService::create()` para
  producir una factura Verifactu completamente sellada — **idempotente** (se convierte una vez, sin
  duplicar), y marca el presupuesto como `converted` enlazándolo.
- Tests: `QuoteServiceTest` (totales/numeración/serie por defecto/borrador/guarda de líneas vacías) + un
  test de integración de crear → estado → convertir → factura sellada → idempotente → PDF. Suite: **44
  tests, 179 aserciones**. Guía 31. Corregido un bug de creación donde un `status` sin definir releía una
  clave inexistente y dejaba el estado en blanco.

**Por qué**
- Los autónomos presupuestan antes de facturar; convertir el presupuesto aceptado en un clic (en una
  factura conforme) es el flujo natural y mantiene la cadena fiscal separada de las ofertas no fiscales.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR — ambas necesitan una API key de Anthropic.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 035: Catálogo de servicios (líneas reutilizables)
**Hecho**
- Añadido un **catálogo de servicios/productos** reutilizable: entidad `Service` (nombre/precio/IVA acotado
  al usuario), CRUD `ServiceController` (`/api/services`), migración `Version20260708075806`, y una pestaña
  **Servicios**. El formulario de factura gana un desplegable **«Añadir del catálogo…»** que añade una línea
  prellenada del servicio elegido (editable). Suite: **40 tests, 157 aserciones** (CRUD + validación +
  aislamiento).

**Por qué**
- Los autónomos facturan los mismos servicios una y otra vez; un catálogo elimina el reescribir. Las líneas
  copian los valores del servicio al crearse, así que borrar un elemento nunca reescribe facturas pasadas.

**Siguiente**
- Presupuestos — documentos no fiscales que se convierten en factura Verifactu real.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 034: Pestañas de facturación + gestión de clientes (CRUD)
**Hecho**
- Convertida la pantalla de Facturas en un apartado de **Facturación** con sub-pestañas (`BillingPage` →
  `Facturas`, `Clientes`; llegan `Presupuestos`/`Servicios`). Añadido **CRUD de clientes**:
  `CustomerController` (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/customers`, acotado al usuario) con **guarda de borrado**
  (409 si el cliente tiene facturas) y `name`/`taxId` obligatorios. Nueva pestaña `Clientes` (listar +
  crear/editar/borrar). Emitir una factura puede reutilizar un cliente existente por **`customerId`**
  (desplegable en el formulario); `InvoiceService` resuelve id → busca-o-crea.
- Tests: un test de integración que cubre crear/listar/actualizar, validación (400), la guarda de borrado
  (409) y el aislamiento por usuario. Suite: **39 tests, 146 aserciones**. Guía 29.

**Por qué**
- Es el paso de "emitir una factura suelta" hacia una herramienta de facturación real: clientes que
  reutilizas, un apartado que albergará presupuestos y un catálogo de servicios a continuación.

**Siguiente**
- Un catálogo de servicios para rellenar líneas, y luego presupuestos con convertir-en-factura.

### 2026-07-08 — Entrada 033: PDF de factura (con QR incrustado)
**Hecho**
- Cada factura se puede descargar ahora como **PDF profesional** (servicio `InvoicePdf` con **Dompdf**, PHP
  puro): emisor/cliente, tabla de líneas, totales, la **huella** Verifactu y el **QR** incrustado como
  `data:` URI en SVG. `GET /api/invoices/{id}/pdf`; la página de facturas muestra un enlace **Descargar
  PDF** junto al de XML. Guía 28. Suite: **38 tests, 134 aserciones** (render unitario + endpoint de
  integración).
- Además, **README** actualizado para mostrar la facturación Verifactu y la banca abierta, con un recuadro
  de ingeniería sobre la cadena de hash y una sección de alcance reescrita con honestidad.

**Por qué**
- El QR/XML eran artefactos de desarrollador; un PDF es el documento que un autónomo envía de verdad. Dompdf
  lo mantiene libre de gd/imagick, y DejaVu Sans renderiza el € y los acentos.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR — ambas necesitan una API key de Anthropic.

### 2026-07-06 — Entrada 032: Banca abierta (GoCardless) — tras un flag de función
**Hecho**
- Construida una importación real de banca abierta vía **GoCardless Bank Account Data** (PSD2):
  `GoCardlessClient` (token → instituciones → requisition → transacciones de cuenta), `OpenBankingService`
  (conectar + importar con mapeo) y `BankController` (`/api/bank/status|institutions|connect|import`). Los
  movimientos llevan ahora un `externalId` (migración `Version20260706103931`) para que las reimportaciones
  **salten duplicados**. Componente frontend `BankConnect` en la página de Movimientos: elige banco →
  autoriza (enlace alojado de GoCardless) → importa.
- **Flag de función:** deshabilitada salvo que estén `GOCARDLESS_SECRET_ID`/`_KEY`; entonces la UI muestra un
  aviso honesto de "no configurada" y los endpoints que la requieren devuelven 503.
- Tests: `GoCardlessClientTest` (MockHttpClient), `OpenBankingServiceTest` (mapeo, fallback al nombre del
  acreedor, conteos de dedup), test de integración de la ruta deshabilitada. Suite: **36 tests, 128
  aserciones**.

**Por qué**
- Crear credenciales de aplicación de GoCardless pide más datos personales de los que tienen sentido para un
  portfolio, así que la integración está construida y **testeada contra la forma documentada de la API pero
  no ejecutada en vivo** — publicarla tras un flag es la forma honesta de mostrar la capacidad sin fingir que
  se ha probado de extremo a extremo.

**Siguiente**
- IA agéntica + OCR — ambas necesitan una API key de Anthropic.

### 2026-07-06 — Entrada 031: Facturación Verifactu — Fase C (QR + XML)
**Hecho**
- Cada factura tiene ya sus dos artefactos Verifactu. `VerifactuQr` construye la URL `ValidarQR` de la AEAT
  (nif, numserie, fecha, importe) y la renderiza como **SVG** con `endroid/qr-code` (el SVG no necesita
  gd/imagick); `VerifactuXml` serializa un XML `RegistroAlta` con `DOMDocument`. Endpoints
  `GET /api/invoices/{id}/qr` (image/svg+xml) y `/xml` (descarga). La página de facturas muestra el QR
  escaneable + un enlace de descarga del XML en el detalle desplegado, con una nota de que es una
  demostración fiel (host de pruebas), no un envío real.
- Tests: `VerifactuDocumentsTest` (campos de la URL del QR, render SVG, XML bien formado + con la huella,
  primer registro vs. encadenado) + cobertura de integración de ambos endpoints. Suite: **28 tests, 106
  aserciones**.

**Por qué**
- SVG en vez de PNG mantiene la imagen Docker y el CI libres de la extensión `gd`/`imagick`. El QR y el XML
  siguen el formato de la AEAT fielmente pero apuntan al host de pruebas — Cuentia no es un emisor
  registrado, así que el envío SOAP real queda en la Fase D (fuera de alcance), como dice el ADR.

**Siguiente**
- Banca abierta (GoCardless Bank Account Data) — importación real de movimientos bancarios.

### 2026-07-06 — Entrada 030: Página de facturas — Verifactu visible en la interfaz
**Hecho**
- Nueva página **Facturas** (React): emitir una factura (cliente + líneas dinámicas con previsualización
  del total en cliente), ver la lista, y desplegar cualquier fila para revelar su **huella Verifactu**
  (hash, el registro con el que encadena, sello temporal). Un botón **«Verificar cadena»** llama a
  `/api/invoices/verify` y muestra una insignia verde «🔒 Cadena íntegra · N registros verificados» (o una
  ámbar «rota en …»). Añadidos la ruta, el enlace del navbar y los textos ES/EN. Build del frontend en
  verde (604 módulos).

**Por qué**
- El motor Verifactu (fases A–B) vivía solo en la API y era invisible para quien abriera la app en vivo.
  Esta página convierte la cadena inalterable en algo que un visitante puede *ver y operar* — el sentido de
  la funcionalidad para un portfolio.

**Siguiente**
- Fase C: el QR de la factura (a la AEAT) y la exportación XML, integrados en esta misma página.

### 2026-07-06 — Entrada 029: Facturación Verifactu — Fase B (cadena de hash inalterable)
**Hecho**
- Cada factura emitida genera ahora un `InvoiceRecord` (registro de alta Verifactu) con una **huella
  SHA-256 encadenada al registro anterior** — el mecanismo antifraude central. Añadidos `VerifactuHasher`
  (cadena canónica + hash), `VerifactuChain` (verificador de integridad), la entidad + repositorio del
  registro, la generación enganchada en `InvoiceService`, y un endpoint `GET /api/invoices/verify`; el
  detalle de factura devuelve ahora su bloque `verifactu` (hash, previousHash, generatedAt). Añadido un
  `taxId` (NIF) al `User` como emisor de la huella. Migración `Version20260706083619`.
- Tests: `VerifactuChainTest` (determinismo, encadenado, detección de manipulación — tanto un campo alterado
  como un registro reesellado pero desenganchado) + un test de integración de extremo a extremo (dos
  facturas → `/verify` ok, count 2, encadenado, aislamiento por usuario). Suite: **24 tests, 86 aserciones**.

**Por qué**
- Un test de campo alterado falló *solo en SQLite*: un `NUMERIC` `1210.00` se releía como `1210`, así que
  la huella recalculada tras el viaje a la BD no coincidía con la sellada (PostgreSQL devuelve `1210.00` y
  lo ocultaba en la prueba en vivo). Lección aprendida: un hash criptográfico nunca debe depender de cómo
  formatee un valor la base de datos — los importes se normalizan a dos decimales en la cadena canónica.

**Siguiente**
- Fase C: el QR de la factura (a la AEAT) y la exportación XML.

### 2026-07-06 — Entrada 028: Facturación Verifactu — Fase A (modelo de dominio)
**Hecho**
- Añadido el dominio de facturación: entidades `Customer`, `Invoice` e `InvoiceLine` (todas ligadas a un
  `User`), sus repositorios, un `InvoiceService` y un `InvoiceController` (`GET`/`POST /api/invoices`,
  `GET /api/invoices/{id}`). La migración `Version20260706075837` crea las tres tablas.
- Los totales se calculan en **céntimos enteros** (nunca floats) y los números de factura son
  **correlativos por serie** (`nextNumber = MAX(number)+1`) — ambos requisitos previos a la cadena de hash
  Verifactu.
- Escrito el [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-verifactu-invoicing.md) (alcance A→D + nota honesta de
  monetización) y la [guía 24](guide/24-verifactu-invoicing.md). Añadido `InvoiceServiceTest`
  (totales/IVA/numeración + guardia de líneas vacías): la suite ya tiene **18 tests, 59 aserciones**.
  Prueba en vivo: una línea al 21 % + dos al 10 % → base 1100.00, IVA 220.00, total 1320.00, número 2026/1.

**Por qué**
- Verifactu (Orden HAC/1177/2024) será obligatorio en 2026; adelantarse lo convierte en un escaparate
  creíble. El modelo de dominio tiene que estar bien — totales exactos al céntimo y numeración sin huecos —
  antes de poner encima la cadena de hash inalterable.

**Siguiente**
- Fase B: el `InvoiceRecord` con el hash SHA-256 encadenado y tests de detección de manipulación.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 027: Hosting gratis — Render + Neon (caducó el trial de Railway)
**Hecho**
- Cambiado el objetivo de despliegue a planes gratuitos: **Render** (servicio web Docker) para el backend y
  **Neon** (PostgreSQL que no se pausa) para la base de datos; Vercel igual. Añadido `render.yaml` (blueprint).
- **Corregido un fallo del Dockerfile**: el `$PORT` de Apache se sustituía en *build* (quedaría vacío);
  ahora se fija al arrancar el contenedor (`${PORT:-8080}`), así funciona en Render/Koyeb/Fly/Railway.
- Actualizada la guía de despliegue (Render + Neon, nota de arranque en frío, alternativa Koyeb).

**Por qué**
- Caducó el trial de Railway y pagar no es opción; como el Dockerfile es agnóstico del host, solo cambian
  las instrucciones de hosting, no la app.

**Siguiente**
- Desplegar en Render + Neon, y luego añadir la URL + capturas al README y fijar el repo.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 026: Configuración de despliegue (Docker + Vercel)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `backend/Dockerfile` (Apache + PHP 8.4, ejecuta migraciones al arrancar), `public/.htaccess`
  (apache-pack), una config `when@prod` (proxies de confianza + cookies seguras) y `frontend/vercel.json`
  (rutas SPA + proxy de `/api` al backend — sin CORS y cookies de sesión de primera parte).
- Escrita una guía de despliegue completa ([guía 23](guide/23-deploy.md)): PostgreSQL (Supabase/Railway),
  backend en Railway con variables, `app:create-user` para el admin, frontend en Vercel, verificación y
  resolución de problemas.
- Tests siguen en verde (16), la app en dev sin cambios.

**Por qué**
- El proxy frontend→backend evita el clásico dolor de cookies cross-domain/CORS y mantiene todo simple. La
  config está lista y documentada; el despliegue real se hace desde las cuentas del usuario.

**Siguiente**
- Publicar (crear cuentas, desplegar), y luego añadir la URL + capturas al README y fijar el repo.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 025: Tests de integración de la API
**Hecho**
- Añadido `tests/Api/ApiIntegrationTest` (WebTestCase): arranca el kernel/firewall/BD reales y prueba
  register/login/me/logout, 401 sin auth, email duplicado 409, **aislamiento por usuario** (A importa 2, B
  ve 0), y limpiar/borrar cuenta.
- Corre sobre **SQLite en memoria** (`.env.test`) con `disableReboot()` — sin servicio de BD; CI instala
  `pdo_sqlite`.
- Cazó dos errores reales: `transaction` es palabra reservada en SQLite (resuelto entrecomillando el nombre
  de la tabla) y el bloqueo de fichero SQLite en Windows (resuelto con la BD en memoria). `php bin/phpunit`
  → **OK (16 tests, 52 assertions)**. Documentado en la [guía 22](guide/22-integration-tests.md).

**Por qué**
- Los tests de integración demuestran que toda la pila está bien cableada — la prueba más fuerte, para un
  entrevistador, de que la app funciona de verdad.

**Siguiente**
- El despliegue en vivo.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 024: Pulido UX — rediseño liquid glass + responsive
**Hecho**
- Rehecho `index.css` como un sistema "liquid glass" (inspirado en iOS/WhatsApp): tarjetas translúcidas
  esmeriladas y una navbar flotante redondeada (`backdrop-filter`), botones/inputs de píldora, fondo con
  tinte, y burbujas de chat estilo WhatsApp (burbuja de usuario en color, radios asimétricos). Tokens claro
  + oscuro.
- Responsive: la navbar se envuelve, los gráficos se apilan, las tablas hacen scroll horizontal
  (`.table-scroll`) en móvil.
- Todo vía tokens/clases — componentes sin cambios. Compila. Documentado en la [guía 21](guide/21-ux-glass.md).

**Por qué**
- Un acabado moderno y coherente en claro/oscuro y escritorio/móvil es lo que hace que el proyecto
  *se sienta* profesional de un vistazo.

**Siguiente**
- Tests de integración de la API, y luego deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 023: Cuenta y RGPD (limpiar datos / borrar cuenta)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `AccountController`: `POST /api/account/clear` (borra los movimientos del usuario) y
  `DELETE /api/account` (borra cuenta + datos, invalida la sesión — derecho al olvido).
- Añadida una página de Cuenta (`/account`, vía el email en la navbar) con limpiar datos, borrar cuenta
  (peligro) y una nota de privacidad; `AuthContext.deleteAccount()`. ES/EN.
- Verificado: limpiar 15→0; borrar cuenta → sesión invalidada. Documentado en la [guía 20](guide/20-account-gdpr.md).

**Por qué**
- Las cuentas reales necesitan una salida (RGPD), y "limpiar mis datos" es un reinicio cómodo para la demo
  en vivo — ambos baratos gracias al aislamiento de datos por usuario.

**Siguiente**
- Pulido UX y responsive, tests de integración de la API, y luego deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 022: Datos de ejemplo + CLI de usuario/admin (pulido)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `POST /api/demo/load`: carga 2 meses de movimientos de ejemplo realistas para el usuario actual
  (solo si está vacío) reutilizando el pipeline real de import + categorización, para que una cuenta nueva
  nunca esté vacía.
- Añadido un botón "Cargar datos de ejemplo" en el estado vacío de Movimientos (ES/EN).
- Añadido el comando de consola `app:create-user` (con `--admin`) para crear cuentas/admins en un deploy.
- Verificado: creado un admin; un usuario nuevo carga 15 movimientos (2 meses, 8 categorías, IVA calculado).
  Documentado en la [guía 19](guide/19-demo-and-admin.md).

**Por qué**
- Para publicar: lo que más mata una demo es una pantalla vacía. Los datos de ejemplo (por el pipeline
  real) hacen la app explorable al instante; el CLI siembra cuentas de servidor con seguridad.

**Siguiente**
- Cuenta y GDPR (borrar/limpiar), pulido UX y responsive, tests de integración de la API, y luego deploy.

### 2026-07-03 — Entrada 021: Autenticación y multiusuario (Fase 4)
**Hecho**
- Añadida entidad `User` + security-bundle de Symfony: proveedor de entidad, `json_login` con sesión,
  logout, control de acceso. Endpoints: `POST /api/register`, `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `GET /api/me`.
- Todo acotado al usuario actual: `Transaction` pertenece a un `User`; las importaciones lo asignan;
  `TransactionRepository::findForUser()`; cada servicio y el SQL de stats filtran por usuario (vía
  `#[CurrentUser]`).
- Frontend: `AuthContext` + `AuthPage` de login/registro; `App` protege toda la app; la navbar muestra el
  email + salir.
- Actualizados todos los tests unitarios a las nuevas firmas. `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (11 tests, 37
  assertions)**. Verificado end-to-end con cookies de sesión (registro → login → datos acotados → 401 sin
  sesión). Documentado en la [guía 18](guide/18-auth.md).

**Por qué**
- El aislamiento de datos multiusuario es lo que convierte esto de una demo en un SaaS real — e imponerlo
  en la capa de consulta es la forma correcta y segura.

**Siguiente**
- Endurecimiento de producción y el deploy en vivo.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 020: Asistente en lenguaje natural (IA + fallback)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `ChatService`: construye un contexto factual (balance, ingresos/gastos, categorías top, IVA,
  próximo pago de IRPF) y le pide a Claude que responda usando solo eso; **fallback** determinista de
  resumen sin clave.
- Añadido `POST /api/chat` y una página **Asistente** (`/chat`) con UI de chat; añadido el enlace en la
  navbar y traducciones ES/EN.
- Añadido `ChatServiceTest` (ruta de fallback). `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (11 tests, 37 assertions)**.
  Documentado en la [guía 17](guide/17-chat.md).

**Por qué**
- El Q&A en lenguaje natural anclado en los datos del propio usuario es la función IA estrella — y el
  fallback la mantiene honesta y siempre utilizable.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 4: autenticación/multiusuario y luego el deploy en vivo.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 019: Previsión de tesorería (empieza la Fase 3)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `ForecastService` (proyección lineal del saldo a +30/60/90 días según el neto diario medio) y
  `GET /api/forecast`.
- Añadido un gráfico de líneas `Forecast` en el Dashboard (saldo actual + neto mensual medio + nota de
  "estimación"). Conectado `/api/forecast` a `useFinanceData`.
- Añadido `ForecastServiceTest`. `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (10 tests, 33 assertions)**. Documentado en la
  [guía 16](guide/16-forecast.md).

**Por qué**
- Una cifra a futuro es lo que de verdad preocupa a un autónomo ("¿llegaré?"), y un modelo transparente y
  claramente etiquetado lo mantiene honesto.

**Siguiente**
- Preguntas en lenguaje natural sobre los movimientos (IA), y luego auth + deploy.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 018: Importador Norma 43 (Fase 2 completa)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `ImportService::importNorma43()` — parsea el formato de ancho fijo Cuaderno 43 de la AEB
  (registro 22 = movimiento, 23 = concepto), y un despachador `import()` que **auto-detecta** CSV vs
  Norma 43 por el contenido.
- El mismo endpoint/botón de subida maneja ambos; el input acepta `.csv` y `.n43`.
- Añadido `ImportServiceTest` (CSV + Norma 43, con registros de 80 caracteres). `php bin/phpunit` →
  **OK (8 tests, 25 assertions)**. Verificado end-to-end con un `.n43` de ejemplo (4 movimientos).
  Documentado en la [guía 15](guide/15-norma43.md). **La Fase 2 está completa.**

**Por qué**
- Norma 43 es lo que exporta cualquier banco español; parsearlo (y nóminas/IVA correctamente) es la
  profundidad de dominio que diferencia el proyecto.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 3 (previsión de tesorería, chat en lenguaje natural, open banking) o preparar el deploy en vivo.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 017: Integración continua (GitHub Actions)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `.github/workflows/ci.yml` con dos jobs en paralelo: **backend** (PHP 8.4 → `composer install`
  → `php bin/phpunit`) y **frontend** (Node 24 → `npm ci` → `npm run build`).
- Añadida una insignia de estado de CI (+ badges de stack) al README.

**Por qué**
- Ejecutar los tests y el build en cada push evita que se fusionen regresiones, y la insignia verde da
  credibilidad instantánea a quien navegue el repo.

**Siguiente**
- Un despliegue en vivo con enlace y capturas en el README.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 016: Tests unitarios de la lógica fiscal (PHPUnit)
**Hecho**
- Instalado PHPUnit (`symfony/test-pack`).
- Añadidos `VatServiceTest` e `IrpfServiceTest`: tests unitarios puros que construyen objetos
  Transaction/Category en memoria y los pasan por un **stub** del repositorio (sin BD). Comprueban el IVA
  (336/23/313), el pago del T1 de IRPF 230,64, la nómina excluida y la cuenta atrás del vencimiento.
- `php bin/phpunit` → **OK (6 tests, 14 assertions)**, sin avisos (usé `createStub`, como recomienda
  PHPUnit 13). Documentado en la [guía 13](guide/13-testing.md).

**Por qué**
- La lógica fiscal es donde más cuesta un error; testearla demuestra corrección, protege de regresiones y
  es un gran argumento en una entrevista.

**Siguiente**
- CI (GitHub Actions ejecutando los tests) + un deploy en vivo, o el importador Norma 43.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 015: Internacionalización (botón ES/EN)
**Hecho**
- Añadido un i18n sin dependencias: diccionario de traducciones (en/es), un `LanguageContext` con
  `useTranslation()` (`{ lang, setLang, t }`), y un botón EN/ES en la navbar. La elección persiste en
  localStorage.
- Sustituidos los textos fijos de la interfaz (navbar, páginas, gráficos, paneles fiscales) por
  `t('clave')`; `t()` admite marcadores `{param}` (p.ej. el aviso de vencimiento del IRPF, prefijo T/Q).
- Idioma por defecto español; cambia al instante. Documentado en la [guía 12](guide/12-i18n.md).

**Por qué**
- Una interfaz bilingüe demuestra pensamiento de producto internacional y muestra el perfil ES/EN del
  autor — encaja con puestos remotos/UE.

**Siguiente**
- Importador Norma 43 (cerrar la Fase 2) y luego temas de producción (tests, auth, deploy).

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 014: Rediseño visual (tokens de diseño, sin "look de IA")
**Hecho**
- Sustituido el CSS de plantilla (acento morado) por un **sistema de tokens de diseño** en `index.css`:
  superficies, tinta, un azul de marca, colores semánticos del dinero, radios, sombras — más un **tema
  oscuro** completo.
- Refactorizados todos los componentes/páginas a **clases** que leen los tokens (`.card`, `.btn`,
  `.table`, `.tag`, `.navbar`, `.stat-value`, `.alert-warn`…). Los gráficos leen `--chart-*` en tiempo de
  ejecución para seguir el tema.
- Estética sobria y financiera (bordes finos, sombras sutiles, cifras tabulares) — deliberadamente lejos
  del look de plantilla de IA. Documentado en la [guía 11](guide/11-visual-redesign.md).

**Por qué**
- Con toda la funcionalidad ya lista, un aspecto limpio y profesional es lo que convierte "funcional" en
  "impresionante" para un reclutador.

**Siguiente**
- Internacionalización: un botón de idioma ES/EN.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 013: Frontend dividido en páginas + navbar (React Router)
**Hecho**
- Añadido React Router: un `Layout` (navbar + `<Outlet/>`) que carga los datos una vez con
  `useFinanceData()` y los comparte con las páginas por el contexto del Outlet.
- Dividida la página única en **Movements** (`/`), **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) y **Taxes** (`/taxes`).
- Extraídos helpers compartidos (`lib/format`, `components/Stat`). Verificado que todas las rutas
  devuelven 200 (fallback SPA) y que el proxy de API sigue funcionando. Documentado en la
  [guía 10](guide/10-frontend-routing.md).

**Por qué**
- Una estructura real de SPA multipágina es más limpia, escalable y lo que un reclutador espera — y
  prepara el terreno para el rediseño visual.

**Siguiente**
- Rediseño visual: un aspecto limpio y profesional que no parezca generado por IA.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 012: Estimación de IRPF (modelo 130) + aviso de vencimiento
**Hecho**
- Añadido `IrpfService` (reutiliza `VatService::baseCents()`): 20% acumulado del neto del año hasta la
  fecha (ingresos de actividad − gastos deducibles, sin IVA), excluyendo la nómina, por trimestre con los
  vencimientos oficiales y una cuenta atrás del "próximo vencimiento".
- Añadido `GET /api/irpf` y un panel de IRPF (tabla de trimestres + banner de aviso cuando falta < 30 días).
- Verificado: neto T1 1153,21 → pago 230,64; próximo vencimiento T2 2026-07-20 (18 días). Documentado en
  la [guía 09](guide/09-irpf.md).

**Por qué**
- IRPF + IVA juntos cuentan una historia fiscal completa — el valor central para un autónomo español y la
  demostración más clara del foso financiero.

**Siguiente**
- Importación Norma 43 y luego el rediseño del frontend.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 011: Panel de IVA (empieza la Fase 2)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `VatService` (mapa categoría → tipo de IVA español, cálculo de IVA en céntimos) y `GET /api/vat`.
- Añadido un panel de IVA en React: IVA repercutido, soportado y neto (a pagar / a compensar).
- Verificado con los datos de ejemplo: repercutido 336,00, soportado 23,00, neto 313,00 a pagar — la
  nómina y la cuota de autónomo correctamente sin IVA. Documentado en la [guía 08](guide/08-vat-panel.md).

**Por qué**
- Este es el foso financiero: calcular el IVA bien (tipos correctos por categoría, nóminas exentas,
  céntimos exactos) es justo el conocimiento del dominio que diferencia este proyecto.

**Siguiente**
- Estimación de IRPF (modelo 130) y avisos de trimestre.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 010: Panel con gráficos
**Hecho**
- Añadido `GET /api/stats` (agregación en SQL: totales, gasto por categoría, ingresos/gastos por mes).
- Añadido un componente `Dashboard` en React (Recharts): barra horizontal de un tono para el gasto por
  categoría y barras de dos series para ingresos vs gastos por mes. Colores elegidos con el método de
  data-viz y **validados** con el script de la skill (CVD ΔE 74.6). Los gráficos se refrescan al
  importar/categorizar.
- Documentado en la [guía 07](guide/07-dashboard.md).

**Por qué**
- Es la pantalla más "vendible": de un vistazo ves a dónde va el dinero — la recompensa del trabajo de
  importación + categorización.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 2: el panel de IVA (repercutido vs soportado, neto a pagar) — el foso financiero.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 009: Categorización con IA (con fallback por reglas)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `CategorizerService`: lista fija de categorías, motor de reglas por palabras clave en español, y
  una llamada opcional a Claude (vía HttpClient) validada contra la lista permitida.
- Añadido `POST /api/transactions/categorize` y un botón "🧠 Categorize" + columna Categoría en React.
- Verificado sin API key: 8/8 categorizadas correctamente por reglas (Mercadona→Supermercado,
  Repsol→Combustible, Nómina→Nómina, etc.). Documentado en la [guía 06](guide/06-ai-categorization.md).

**Por qué**
- La categorización convierte una lista en información útil. Mantener la IA opcional (fallback por reglas)
  hace que la app siempre funcione y sea honesta — un principio de arquitectura deliberado.

**Siguiente**
- Panel: gasto por categoría y por mes (Recharts), y luego el panel de IVA (Fase 2).

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 008: Listar movimientos (bucle visible de punta a punta)
**Hecho**
- Añadido `GET /api/transactions` (mapea entidades a un array DTO plano, ordenado por fecha).
- Reescrito el `App.jsx` de React: tabla de movimientos (formato euro, rojo/verde según signo), un
  resumen de ingresos/gastos/balance, y un input de fichero que sube un CSV (FormData) y refresca.
- Verificado: el endpoint devuelve 8 filas a través del proxy de Vite y el frontend compila sin errores.
  Documentado en la [guía 05](guide/05-list-transactions.md).

**Por qué**
- Primer bucle totalmente visible: subes un CSV → ves tus movimientos. Convierte el trabajo del backend
  en algo que una persona (o un reclutador) puede ver de verdad.

**Siguiente**
- Categorización con IA: asignar una categoría a cada movimiento con Claude + fallback por reglas.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 007: Importación CSV
**Hecho**
- Añadido `ImportService` (parsea un CSV bancario) y `POST /api/import/csv` (controlador fino).
- El parser autodetecta el separador `,`/`;`, mapea columnas bilingües y maneja el formato numérico
  español (`1.234,56`) — manteniendo el dinero como string decimal exacto.
- Añadido un fichero de ejemplo y verificado de punta a punta: importadas 8 filas (balance 3316.21),
  0 errores, acentos preservados. Documentado en la [guía 04](guide/04-csv-import.md).

**Por qué**
- Es el primer valor tangible: un extracto real del banco se convierte en datos estructurados. Mantener
  correcto el parseo financiero (decimales españoles, sin float) es el diferenciador.

**Siguiente**
- Exponer los movimientos vía un endpoint de API y mostrarlos en el frontend React.

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 006: Base de datos + modelo de dominio (empieza la Fase 1)
**Hecho**
- Instalado Doctrine (`symfony/orm-pack`) y MakerBundle.
- Arrancado PostgreSQL local (`pg_ctl`), configurado `DATABASE_URL` en `.env.local`, creada la base de
  datos `cuentia`.
- Escritas las entidades `Category` y `Transaction` (+ repositorios); generada y ejecutada la primera
  migración. Ya existen las tablas `category` y `transaction`.
- Documentado en la [guía 03](guide/03-database-and-entities.md). Decidido usar IDs enteros
  autoincrementales por ahora (más simple que UUID); actualizada la ARQUITECTURA en consecuencia.

**Por qué**
- Las entidades son la columna vertebral de la app. Hacer bien el dinero desde el primer día
  (`decimal`, no float) evita toda una familia de errores de contabilidad.

**Siguiente**
- Importación CSV: un endpoint que parsea un CSV bancario y guarda filas `Transaction` (guía 04).

### 2026-07-02 — Entrada 005: Frontend React + Fase 0 completa
**Hecho**
- Generada la app React (Vite) en `frontend/`; añadido un **proxy** de desarrollo (`/api` → `:8000`)
  para evitar CORS.
- `App.jsx` llama a `GET /api/health` al montarse y muestra "✅ API OK".
- Verificado de punta a punta: con ambos servidores en marcha, `http://localhost:5173/api/health` se
  reenvía por proxy al backend y devuelve el JSON. **La Fase 0 está completa.**
- Documentado en la [guía 02](guide/02-frontend-scaffold.md), incluyendo el detalle real de
  `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1` (IPv6) que nos pasó.

**Por qué**
- Demostrar ya el enlace frontend↔backend, con la función más simple posible, hace que cada función
  posterior se construya sobre una base que sabemos que funciona.

**Siguiente**
- Fase 1: modelo de dominio (`Transaction`, `Category`), PostgreSQL vía Doctrine e importación CSV
  (guía 03).

### 2026-07-01 — Entrada 004: Scaffold del backend + primer verde
**Hecho**
- Generada la API Symfony 8.1 en `backend/` (`symfony new backend`); eliminado su `.git` anidado
  para mantener un único monorepo.
- Añadido `HealthController` con `GET /api/health`; verificado que devuelve
  `{"status":"ok","service":"cuentia-api"}` con un servidor local.
- Documentado todo en la [`guide/`](guide/) didáctica (00-entorno, 01-scaffold del backend).

**Por qué**
- Un endpoint de salud es la prueba más pequeña posible de que la cadena
  petición→controlador→respuesta funciona — el primer hito correcto antes de añadir base de datos o
  funciones.

**Siguiente**
- Generar el frontend React (Vite) y que llame a `/api/health` (guía 02).

### 2026-07-01 — Entrada 003: Repo publicado + entorno instalado
**Hecho**
- Creado y pusheado el repo público: **github.com/R0b3r7DEV/cuentia** (primer commit = docs).
- Instalado el entorno del backend con Scoop: **PHP 8.5.7**, **Composer 2.10.2**,
  **Symfony CLI 5.17.1**, **PostgreSQL 18.4** (clúster inicializado; auth `trust` en local).
- Creado un `php.ini` que habilita las extensiones que Symfony necesita: `pdo_pgsql`, `pgsql`,
  `intl`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `curl`, `fileinfo`, `sodium`, `zip`.

**Por qué**
- Construir en público desde el commit 1 cuenta una buena historia; un entorno local funcionando
  desbloquea la Fase 0.

**Siguiente**
- Generar la API Symfony y la app React; primer "verde" `GET /api/health` → 200.

### 2026-07-01 — Entrada 002: Documentación bilingüe
**Hecho:** toda la documentación es ahora bilingüe (inglés primero, español debajo).
**Por qué:** el autor usa los docs en español mientras aprende, y el reclutador lee el inglés.
**Siguiente:** lo mismo que la entrada 001 — instalar herramientas y generar el scaffold.

### 2026-07-01 — Entrada 001: Proyecto decidido, cimientos puestos
**Hecho**
- Elegido proyecto y stack (ver [ADR 0002](decisions/0002-project-and-stack.md)):
  *Cuentia*, un copiloto financiero con IA, sobre **Symfony + React + PostgreSQL + Claude**.
- Creado el esqueleto de documentación: README, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, ADR 0001, ADR 0002 y este diario.
- Definido el modelo de dominio inicial (`Transaction`, `Category`) y el roadmap por fases.

**Por qué**
- Empezar con el *porqué* escrito (ADRs) y un plan por fases mantiene el foco y hace que cada decisión
  sea defendible más adelante — que es justo el objetivo de este proyecto.

**Siguiente**
- Instalar el tooling del backend: PHP, Composer, Symfony CLI, PostgreSQL (Fase 0).
- Generar la API Symfony y la app React; conseguir un `GET /api/health` que devuelva 200.
